# Courses

Welcome to this folder!

This folder contains all the assignments and submissions completed during my enrollment in various courses related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These assignments cover a wide range of topics, including data analysis, data visualization, machine learning algorithms, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

Each assignment is organized in a separate directory and contains the relevant files and codes to complete the task. The README file in each assignment directory provides information about the specific assignment, including the requirements, objectives, and instructions to run the code.

Feel free to explore the assignments and check out my solutions. I hope that my work inspires you and helps you learn more about the exciting field of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
